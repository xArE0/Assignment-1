HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Explanation

1. What is HTTP
   - It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
   - It is a protocol used for transferring data (hypertext) between a browser (client) and a server.

2. Process
   - The user enters a URL.
   - A DNS lookup resolves the server's address.
   - The client sends an HTTP request.
   - The client receives an HTTP response.
   - The browser renders the page based on the response.

3. Request
   - Consists of a Method (GET, POST, etc.) and the protocol Version.
   - Contains Headers (metadata) and an optional Body (data sent to server).

4. Response
   - Contains a Status Code indicating success or failure.
   - Includes Headers (metadata like content type) and a Body (the resource content, e.g., HTML).

5. Status Codes
   - 1xx: Informational messages.
   - 2xx: Success (e.g., 200 OK).
   - 3xx: Redirection (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently).
   - 4xx: Client error (e.g., 404 Not Found).
   - 5xx: Server error (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).

6. Versions
   - HTTP/1.1: The basic, standardized version, still widely used but can be slower due to head-of-line blocking.
   - HTTP/2: Faster/more efficient, supports multiplexing (multiple requests over one connection).
   - HTTP/3: The newest version, built on QUIC (UDP) for lower latency and better handling of packet loss.

7. Pros
   - Low resource usage: Efficient simple protocol.
   - Less congestion: Especially with newer versions managing connections better.

8. Cons
   - Not encrypted: Basic HTTP is plain text (HTTPS solves this with TLS).
   - High power use: Continuous establishment of connections in older versions could consume more resources compared to persistent connections.
