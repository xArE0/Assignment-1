How Browsers Work Explanation

1. URLs
   - The process begins when the user enters a URL into the address bar.
   - The browser performs URL normalization to ensure the address is correctly formatted.

2. HTTP Request
   - The browser converts the URL into an HTTP request format.
   - Necessary request headers (like User-Agent, Accept) are prepared.

3. DNS Resolution
   - The browser cannot use the domain name directly to connect; it needs an IP address.
   - A DNS (Domain Name System) lookup is performed to resolve the domain name to an IP address.

4. TCP Connection
   - A Three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) establishes a reliable connection between the browser and the server using the TCP protocol.

5. HTTP Exchange
   - The Request is sent over the established TCP connection.
   - The Server processes the request and sends back a Response (containing HTML, status code, etc.) to the browser.

6. HTML Parsing
   - The browser receives the response data (bytes) and converts them into characters, then into Tokens.
   - These tokens are used to construct the DOM (Document Object Model) tree.
   - This process is streaming (happens as data arrives) and error-tolerant (browser fixes bad HTML).

7. DOM Importance
   - The DOM is the in-memory representation of the document.
   - It is the interface that JavaScript uses to interact with the page.
   - It is essential for CSS application and querying elements.

8. Rendering Pipeline
   - Layout: The browser calculates the exact size and position of each element on the screen.
   - Paint: The browser fills in pixels (colors, images, borders, shadows).
   - Composite: Layers are stitched together by the GPU to display the final image on the screen.
